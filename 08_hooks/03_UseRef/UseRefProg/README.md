# React Concepts

## useRef Hook
`useRef` is a React Hook that lets you reference a value that's not needed for rendering. Unlike states, it's directly mutable. You can access its value using `yourRef.current`.

## Uncontrolled Components
Uncontrolled components manage their own state internally and are typically used with refs.
